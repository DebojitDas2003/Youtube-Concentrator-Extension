# Youtube-Concentrator-Extension
this chrome extension will help to increase concentration while studying using youtube.
It will work in several steps:

1. Skip the ads whenever they appear.

2. Find the length of the video and set that as a timer which will turn on a temporary lockdown on the video, so that students don't get lurked by attracting videos or thumbnails.

3. show a timer in only minutes which will update every 5 minutes. If a student pauses the video the timer will also stop until he/she plays it again.

4. Disable video selection (thumbnails and video titles) and the Next Video button until the timer ends.

5. Enable everything after the timer ends.
